    "# Title: TensorFlow Playground\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**:  \n",
    "TensorFlow Playground is an interactive web application that allows users to experiment with neural networks in a visually engaging way. It helps users understand how different configurations of neural networks (like layers, activation functions, and learning rates) affect the model's ability to classify data points. Through this tool, students can gain hands-on experience in machine learning and neural network concepts.\n",

    "**Link of Tool**:  \n",
    "[TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Neural Networks**:  \n",
    "   * Students can visualize how neurons are connected and how they function together to classify data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Experimenting with Data Sets**:  \n",
    "   * Users can choose from various datasets (e.g., circles, spirals) to see how different configurations affect classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adjusting Network Parameters**:  \n",
    "   * Students can modify parameters like learning rate, activation functions, and batch size to observe their impact on model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analyzing Decision Boundaries**:  \n",
    "   * Users can see how the decision boundary evolves during training and how well the model classifies different classes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Comparing Model Performance**:  \n",
    "   * Students can run multiple experiments with different configurations and compare the results to learn which settings yield the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Learning Activation Functions**:  \n",
    "   * Users can explore how different activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid) affect the learning process and output of the network.\n"
